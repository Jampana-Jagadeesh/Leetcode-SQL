# SQL Practice Readme
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/):ðŸ“‚A popular platform for practicing coding skills, including SQL.
## Overview
Welcome to our SQL practice repository! This repository contains a collection of SQL Leetcode problems and solutions.

## How to Use
1. **Problem Statements**: Each problem is accompanied by a problem statement that describes the task you need to accomplish using SQL queries.
2. **Database Schema**: We provide a database schema that outlines the structure of the tables you'll be working with. Understanding the schema is crucial for solving the problems.
3. **Solution Files**: For each problem, you'll find one or more SQL files containing possible solutions. These files include comments explaining the logic behind the queries.
4. **Testing**: After writing your solution, you can test it against the provided database to verify its correctness. Feel free to use your preferred SQL environment or tool.
5. **Discussion**: If you're stuck or have questions about a particular problem, don't hesitate to open an issue or start a discussion. Collaboration and sharing insights are encouraged!

## Repository Structure
- `README.md/`: Contains individual folders for each problem, each with its own problem statement and solution files.
- `Solution/`: Contains the SQL file(s) for creating the database schema and sample data.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
